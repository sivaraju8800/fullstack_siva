        <h6>Core Java</h6>
        <p>
           Java is a versatile, object-oriented, and platform-independent 
           programming language used for a wide range of applications, including 
           web development, mobile apps, enterprise software, and more.
            Developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle), it's known 
            for its "write once, run anywhere" capability thanks to the 
            Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
