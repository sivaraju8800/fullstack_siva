        <h6>Descrete Mathematical Structures</h6>
        <p>
           Discrete mathematical structures are mathematical structures built 
           from discrete (countable) objects rather than continuous ones. 
           These structures are fundamental in computer science, providing 
           the foundation for many algorithms and data structures. 
           Key topics include sets, relations, 
           functions, graphs, trees, logic, and algebraic structures.
