        <h6>Accounting and Financial management</h6>
        <p>
           Accounting and finance management are both crucial aspects of business, 
           but they have distinct focuses. Accounting is primarily concerned 
           with recording, classifying, and summarizing financial transactions to 
           provide a clear picture of a company's financial health. 
           Finance, on the other hand, focuses on the management of a 
           company's monetary resources, 
           including planning, investing, and risk management.
